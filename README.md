# WebAssembly System Interface

![WASI](WASI.png)

This repository accompanies the WebAssembly WASI Subgroup,
focused on the design of the WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface.

We'll be adding more content here, but for now, check out these:
 - https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/ - Blog post introducing WASI
 - https://wasi.dev/ - Links to more information about WASI
 - https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues - This repo's issue tracker

The issue tracker is the place to ask questions, make suggestions, and start
discussions.

As a W3C CG Subgroup, we'll also be having meetings. Once we have a schedule
for those, we'll post that here also.
